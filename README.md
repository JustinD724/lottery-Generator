update: the user I discovered this from, I do not know who made this. But it has been major help for me to experiment and work around the main code. It has allowed me to look more into
the factory function. For I have never heard of that before. So using this code has helped me learn more.

update:
I had changed some things around and functions. What I would like to do now is
print the output of my results, everytime I run it, and STORE/APPEND those results in a TXT file.
To further compare data and investigate results on my own time.

And here are some interesting statistics on Lottery winners (after they won), their behaviors and what they did with thier money: http://www.statisticbrain.com/lottery-winner-statistics/

The object is to give a good random selection of lottery numbers. 

There is no weighting towards number frequency (which could make for an interesting addition later).

Although this won't scale, it is a good start.  It needs more states/lottery options. That means there will need to be a few additional files to break out of this one page program. It will possibly need another option selector added for state, maybe a fourth, for country if it gets that big.

I should set mega-millions and powerball the first options by default since most all U.S. states participate in those.

The option menu chain should go like this: country->state->lottery
- Country Selector
- State (province) Selector
- Lottery Type Selector
